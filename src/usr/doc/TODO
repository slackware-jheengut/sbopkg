SBOPKG TODO

Items should be grouped by {High,Medium,Low} Priorities with sub-groups
of {Feature,Modification,Bugfix} Categories.

MEDIUM PRIORITY

    Feature Category

        * Add lftp to sync methods.

	* Add flag to skip prompts and force building packages or queues
          when both exist with the same name. (Suggested by OzanBurada.)

    Modification Category

        * Properly test supplied options to ensure that only sensible
          option combinations are allowed, thus replacing the current
          crude test which only prevents -b and -i from being used
          together.

        * Change generated tag from _SBo -> _sbopkg
          http://slackbuilds.org/faq/#package_repos

	* Add third party source repository
	  This feature is tracked under sbosrcarch branch

LOW PRIORITY

    Feature Category

        * Replace getopts call with custom option parsing and add 'long'
          switches to the cli options (for example, '--build' in
          addition to the current '-b' switch).

        * Replace all calls to dialog with a DIALOG variable (which
          would still default to dialog), allowing users to more easily
          try other interfaces.

	* Use sqg to generate one queue file for multiple programs

    Modification Category

        * Smooth out the oddities regarding which vars can be passed how
          (such as BUILD and TAG).
